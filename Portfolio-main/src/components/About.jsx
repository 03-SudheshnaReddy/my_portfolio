        I'm a passionate web developer with strong experience in JavaScript and hands-on expertise in modern frameworks like React, Node.js, and Three.js. I enjoy solving real-world problems by building efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications.

Currently, I'm deeply focused on machine learning, problem solving, and strengthening my foundation in core computer science subjects. My goal is to excel in tech and build a meaningful, impactful career.

Outside of tech, I’m an avid sports enthusiast. I love playing badminton, table tennis, tennis, squash, carroms, and chess in my free time — always striving to grow both technically and personally. Whether it's on the court or in front of a compiler, I bring energy, focus, and a constant drive to improve.
